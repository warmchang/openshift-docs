[role="_abstract"]
To update existing objects to their latest version without recreating them, use storage version migration in {microshift-short}. By creating a `StorageVersionMigration` custom resource (CR), you request the Kube Storage Version Migrator embedded controller to handle the transition automatically.

Either you or a controller can create a `StorageVersionMigration` custom resource (CR) that requests a migration through the Migrator Controller.
