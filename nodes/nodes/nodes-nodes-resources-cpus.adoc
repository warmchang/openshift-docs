[role="_abstract"]
When using the static CPU Manager policy, you can explicitly define a list of CPUs that are reserved for critical system processes on specific nodes. Reserving CPUs for critical system processes can help ensure cluster stability.

For example, on a system with 24 CPUs, you could reserve CPUs numbered 0 - 3 for the control plane allowing the compute nodes to use CPUs 4 - 23.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.
