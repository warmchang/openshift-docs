= Copying files to or from {product-title} containers

toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the `oc rsync` command, or remote sync, to copy local files to or from a remote directory in a {product-title} container.

//taken from nodes-containers-copying-files-about.adoc
The `oc rsync` command leverages the local Rsync tool on the client machine and the remote container for tasks such as copying database archives to and from your pods for backup and restore purposes,
or copying source code changes into a running pod for development debugging.

//taken from nodes-containers-copying-files-procedure.adoc
[NOTE]
====
If the Rsync tool is not found locally or in the remote container, a *tar* archive
is created locally and sent to the container where the *tar* utility is used to
extract the files. If *tar* is not available in the remote container, the
copy fails.
