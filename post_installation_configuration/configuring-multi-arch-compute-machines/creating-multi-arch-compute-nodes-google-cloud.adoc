[role="_abstract"]
To deploy a cluster on {gcp-full} with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture installer-provisioned cluster that uses the multi-architecture installer binary. 

You can also migrate your current cluster with single-architecture compute machines to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines. After creating a multi-architecture cluster, you can add nodes with different architectures to the cluster.
