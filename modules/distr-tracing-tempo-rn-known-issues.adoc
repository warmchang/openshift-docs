The {TempoShortName} 3.9 release has the following known issue.

Gateway fails to forward OTLP HTTP traffic when receiver TLS is enabled::
When Tempo Monolithic is configured with `multitenancy.enabled: true` and `ingestion.otlp.http.tls.enabled: true`, the gateway forwards OTLP HTTP traffic to the Tempo receiver using plain HTTP instead of HTTPS. As a consequence, the connection fails with a `connection reset by peer` error because the receiver expects TLS connections. OTLP gRPC ingestion through the gateway is not affected.
+
To work around this problem, disable TLS on the OTLP HTTP receiver by setting `ingestion.otlp.http.tls.enabled: false`.
