= Network Observability Operator 1.11 known issues

[role="_abstract"]
The following known issues affect the Network Observability Operator 1.11 release.

Health rules do not trigger when the sampling rate increases because of `lowVolumeThreshold`::
Network observability alerts might not trigger when an elevated sampling rate causes the volume to fall below the `lowVolumeThreshold` filter. This results in fewer alerts being evaluated or displayed.
+
To work around this problem, adjust the `lowVolumeThreshold` value to align with the sampling rate to ensure consistent alert evaluation.

DNS metrics unavailable when Loki is disabled::
When the `DNSTracking` feature is enabled in a "Loki-less" installation, the required metrics for DNS graphs are unavailable. As a consequence, you cannot view DNS latency and response codes in the dashboard.
+
To work around this problem, you must either disable the `DNSTracking` option or enable Loki in the `FlowCollector` resource by setting `spec.loki.enable` to true.
