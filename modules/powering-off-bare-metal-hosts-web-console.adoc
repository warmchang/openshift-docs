= Powering off bare-metal hosts by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can power off bare-metal cluster hosts in the web console. Before you power off a host, mark the node as unschedulable and drain all pods and workloads from the node.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed a {op-system} compute machine on bare-metal infrastructure for use in the cluster.
* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have configured the host to be managed and have added Baseboard Management Console credentials for the cluster host. You can add BMC credentials by applying a `Secret` custom resource (CR) in the cluster or by logging in to the web console and configuring the bare-metal host to be managed.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Nodes* and select the node that you want to power off. Expand the *Actions* menu and select *Mark as unschedulable*.

. Manually delete or relocate running pods on the node by adjusting the pod deployments or scaling down workloads on the node to zero. Wait for the drain process to complete.

. Navigate to *Compute* -> *Bare Metal Hosts*.

. Expand the *Options menu* for the bare-metal host that you want to power off, and select *Power Off*.

. Select *Immediate power off*.
