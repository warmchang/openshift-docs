= Creating a physical network by using the {product-title} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can create physical networks for {VirtProductName} using the {product-title} web console to create a network with direct layer 2 connectivity to your data center.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title} web console, go to *Networking* -> *Physical networks*.
. Click *Create network*. The *Network configuration wizard* is displayed.
. On the *Network identity* page, enter a name for your network.
. On the *Nodes configuration* page, select either *Apply to all nodes on the cluster* or *Apply to specific subsets of nodes using the nodes selector*.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you select specific nodes to apply the network to, you can view the matching nodes list to ensure the selection is correct. A validation error is displayed if the selected nodes overlap with another configuration associated with the same network.
====
. On the *Uplink connection* page, select the network interface that you want to connect to the physical network:
+
Default node network:: Uses the default node network to access the outside physical network.
A single interface:: Select a specific physical network interface from the list.
+
[WARNING]
====
If the selected secondary interface has an IP address on some of the nodes, using it removes the IP address and might disrupt network services.
====
Bonding interface:: Configures bonded network interfaces to achieve resilience and higher throughput.
+
.. Enter a *Bonding name*.
.. Select the *Network interfaces* to bond.
.. Select the *Aggregation mode* from the drop-down menu.
. On the *Settings* page, enter a *Bridge name* and set the *Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)*.
. Review the configuration details.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification
. In the {product-title} web console, go to *Networking* -> *Physical networks*.
. Locate your new network in the list.
. Expand the network row to view the associated configurations. Verify that the *Enactment state* is *Available* and that the *Nodes* count matches your expectation.
