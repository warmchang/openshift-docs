= Admin quota usage

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure projects remain within defined constraints, monitor admin quota usage. By tracking the aggregate consumption of compute resources and storage, you can identify when `ResourceQuota` limits are reached or approached.

Quota enforcement::
+
After a resource quota for a project is first created, the project restricts the ability to create any new resources that can violate a quota constraint until the quota has calculated updated usage statistics.
+
After a quota is created and usage statistics are updated, the project accepts the creation of new content. When you create or modify resources, your quota usage is incremented immediately upon the request to create or modify the resource.
+
When you delete a resource, your quota use is decremented during the next full recalculation of quota statistics for the project.
+
A configurable amount of time determines how long the quota takes to reduce quota usage statistics to their current observed system value.
+
If project modifications exceed a quota usage limit, the server denies the action and returns an appropriate error message to the user. The error message explains the quota constraint violated and what their currently observed usage statistics are in the system.

Requests compared to limits::
+
When allocating compute resources by quota, each container can specify a request and a limit value each for CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage. Quotas can restrict any of these values.
+
If the quota has a value specified for `requests.cpu` or `requests.memory`, then the quota requires that every incoming container makes an explicit request for those resources. If the quota has a value specified for `limits.cpu` or `limits.memory`, the quota requires that every incoming container specify an explicit limit for those resources.
