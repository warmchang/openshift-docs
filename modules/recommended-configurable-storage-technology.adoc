where:

`ROX`:: Specifies `ReadOnlyMany` access mode.

`ROX.Yes`:: Specifies that this access mode 

`RWX`:: Specifies `ReadWriteMany` access mode.

`Metrics`:: Specifies Prometheus as the underlying technology used for metrics.

`Metrics.Configurable`:: For metrics, using file storage with the `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode is unreliable. If you use file storage, do not configure the RWX access mode on any persistent volume claims (PVCs) that are configured for use with metrics.

`Elasticsearch Logging.Configurable`:: For logging, review the recommended storage solution in Configuring persistent storage for the log store section. Using NFS storage as a persistent volume or through NAS, such as Gluster, can corrupt the data. Therefore, NFS is not supported for Elasticsearch storage and LokiStack log store in {product-title} Logging. You must use one persistent volume type per log store.

`Apps.Not configurable`:: Specifies that object storage is not consumed through PVs or PVCs of {product-title}. Apps must integrate with the object storage REST API.

A scaled registry is an {product-registry} where two or more pod replicas are running.
