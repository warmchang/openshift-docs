= About LVM volume cloning

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the logical volume manager storage (LVMS) for persistent volume claim (PVC) cloning of the logical volume manager (LVM) thin volumes. A clone is a duplicate of an existing volume that can be used like any other volume. 

When you provision the clone, an exact duplicate of the original volume is created if the data source references a source PVC in the same namespace. After a cloned PVC is created, the cloned VPC is considered a new object and completely separate from the source PVC. The clone represents a snapshot of the data from the source at the moment in time.

[NOTE]
====
Cloning is only possible when the source and destination PVCs are in the same namespace. To create PVC clones, you must configure thin volumes on the {op-system-ostree} host.
