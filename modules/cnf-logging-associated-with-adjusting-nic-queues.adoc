= Logging associated with adjusting NIC queues

[role="_abstract"]
To verify NIC queue adjustments, review the Tuned daemon logs. These logs record messages detailing the assigned devices so that you can confirm that the system applied your configuration changes correctly.

The following messages might be recorded to the `/var/log/tuned/tuned.log` file:

* An `INFO` message is recorded detailing the successfully assigned devices:
+
[source,terminal]
----
INFO tuned.plugins.base: instance net_test (net): assigning devices ens1, ens2, ens3
----

* A `WARNING` message is recorded if none of the devices can be assigned:
+
[source,terminal]
----
WARNING  tuned.plugins.base: instance net_test: no matching devices available
----
