= Installing a CNI plugin

[role="_abstract"]
After creating a {product-title} cluster without a CNI plugin, you must install the CNI plugin before the cluster can operate. Because the nodes are not ready, the workloads cannot deploy. For example, the {product-title} cluster web console is not available, so you must use the {oc-first} to log in to the cluster. Additionally, other OpenShift components such as the HAProxy-based Ingress Controller, image registry, and prometheus-based monitoring stack are not running. This is expected behavior until you install a CNI provider.

.Procedure

* Install your CNI plugin.

The nodes change from the `not ready` to `ready` state.
