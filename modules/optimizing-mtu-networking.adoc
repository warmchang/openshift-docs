= Optimizing the MTU for your network

[role="_abstract"]
To optimize network performance, configure the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) settings. By understanding the relationship between the network interface controller (NIC) MTU and the cluster network MTU, you can ensure efficient data transmission and prevent packet fragmentation.

The NIC MTU is configured at the time of {product-title} installation, and you can also change the MTU of a cluster as a postinstallation task. For more information, see "Changing cluster network MTU".

For a cluster that uses the OVN-Kubernetes plugin, the MTU must be at least `100` bytes less than the maximum supported value of the NIC of your network. If you are optimizing for throughput, choose the largest possible value, such as `8900`. If you are optimizing for lowest latency, choose a lower value.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes plugin and the network uses a NIC to send and receive unfragmented jumbo frame packets over the network, you must specify `9000` bytes as the MTU value for the NIC so that pods do not fail.
