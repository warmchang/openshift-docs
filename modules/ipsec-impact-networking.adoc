= Impact of IPsec

[role="_abstract"]
To account for performance overhead, review the impact of enabling IPsec. Encrypting and decrypting traffic on node hosts consumes CPU power, which affects both throughput and CPU usage regardless of the specific IP security system.

IPSec encrypts traffic at the IP payload level, before it hits the NIC, protecting fields that would otherwise be used for NIC offloading. This means that some NIC acceleration features might not be usable when IPSec is enabled. This situation leads to decreased throughput and increased CPU usage.
