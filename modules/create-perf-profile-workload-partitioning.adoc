= Performance profiles and workload partitioning

[role="_abstract"]
To enable workload partitioning, apply a performance profile. This configuration specifies the isolated and reserved CPUs, ensuring that customer workloads run on dedicated cores without interruption from platform processes.

An appropriately configured performance profile specifies the `isolated` and `reserved` CPUs. Create a performance profile by using the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool.
