= Adding worker nodes using the Assisted Installer API

[role="_abstract"]
You can add worker nodes to clusters by writing command-line commands against the Assisted Installer REST API. This method provides an alternative to using the web console.

Before you add worker nodes, you must log in to link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/show[{cluster-manager}] and authenticate against the API. After you authenticate, you can use the Assisted Installer REST API to add the nodes.
