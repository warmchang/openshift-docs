The {TempoShortName} 3.9 release adds the following features and enhancements.

Upgrade to UBI 9::
This release upgrades the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) to version 9.

Network policies in `TempoStack` CRD::
This update extends the `TempoStack` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) with a network policy option that enables the Operator to reconcile network policies among all components. This option is enabled by default.

Environment variables for Operator configuration::
This update adds support for overriding the Operator configuration by using environment variables. You can configure Operator settings through the `Subscription` custom resource of the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) without modifying ConfigMaps. The `--config` flag remains available for custom configuration files if needed.

T-shirt sizes for `TempoStack` deployments::
This update introduces the `size` field for `TempoStack` deployments, which provides predefined t-shirt size configurations. Instead of manually calculating CPU, memory, and storage for each component, you can select a size that matches your workload scale. The following sizes are available: `1x.demo`, `1x.pico`, `1x.extra-small`, `1x.small`, and `1x.medium`. This field is optional and existing configurations using `resources.total` or per-component overrides continue to work unchanged.

Improved memory management for `TempoMonolithic` deployments::
The Operator now automatically sets the `GOMEMLIMIT` soft memory limit for the Go garbage collector to 80% of the container memory limit for all Tempo components in a Tempo monolithic deployment. This reduces the likelihood of out-of-memory terminations.

A `TempoStack` or `TempoMonolithic` instance without the gateway is not supported::
This update requires tenant configuration and an enabled gateway for `TempoStack` and `TempoMonolithic` instances. If you do not enable the gateway, the Operator displays a warning. For a `TempoStack` instance, enable the gateway by setting `.spec.template.gateway.enabled` to `true`. For a `TempoMonolithic` instance, the gateway is enabled automatically when any tenant is configured. `TempoStack` and `TempoMonolithic` instances without an enabled gateway are not supported.
