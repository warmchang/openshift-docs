= About the must-gather tool

[role="_abstract"]
To debug issues in your cluster, use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command. This tool collects the diagnostic information most likely needed for troubleshooting, ensuring that you have the necessary data for analysis.

The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the following information from your cluster:

* Resource definitions
* Audit logs
* Service logs

You can specify one or more images when you run the command by including the `--image` argument. When you specify an image, the tool collects data related to that feature or product. When you run `oc adm must-gather`, a new pod is created on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local`. This directory is created in your current working directory.
