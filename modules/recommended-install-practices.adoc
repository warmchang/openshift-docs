= Recommended practices for installing large-scale clusters

[role="_abstract"]
To support large clusters or scale to higher node counts, configure the cluster network `cidr` in your `install-config.yaml` file before installation. Setting this address range correctly ensures your cluster has sufficient capacity for the required number of nodes.

** The default cluster network `cidr` `10.128.0.0/14` cannot be used if the cluster size is more than 500 nodes. The `cidr` must be set to `10.128.0.0/12` or `10.128.0.0/10` to support larger node counts beyond 500 nodes.
