= Configuring an htpasswd identity provider with the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can create an htpasswd identity provider (IDP) with the {rosa-cli-first} tool.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured the latest version of the {rosa-cli}.

.Procedure

* Run the following command to create an htpasswd IDP by passing the usernames and passwords in the command-line interface:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create idp --type=htpasswd -c  <cluster_name> --users='user1:password1,user2:password2,user3:password3'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `--users` string value must be a comma separated list of `username:password,` within quotes like `"user1:password"` to create a user account with a name of `user1` and a password of `password`. The quotes prevent your password from disrupting the Bash commands.

Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers or symbols, specifically, ASCII-standard characters only. The password must be at least 14 characters.
