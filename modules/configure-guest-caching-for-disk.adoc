[id="configure-guest-caching-for-disk_{context}"]
= Configure guest caching for disk

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure that the guest manages caching instead of the host, configure your disk devices. This setting shifts caching responsibility to the guest operating system, preventing the host from caching disk operations.

Ensure that the driver element of the disk device includes the `cache="none"` and `io="native"` parameters.

.Example configuration
[source,xml]
----
<disk type="block" device="disk">
    <driver name="qemu" type="raw" cache="none" io="native" iothread="1"/>

</disk>
