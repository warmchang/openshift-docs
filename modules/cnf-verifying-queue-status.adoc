= Verifying the queue status

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure that your performance profile changes are active, verify the queue status. Reviewing these examples helps you confirm that specific tuning configurations are successfully applied to your environment.

In this section, several examples illustrate different performance profiles and how to verify the changes are applied.

Example 1::
+
Example 1 demonstrates that the net queue count that is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for _all_ supported devices.
+
The relevant section from the performance profile is:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
metadata:
  name: performance
spec:
  kind: PerformanceProfile
  spec:
    cpu:
      reserved: 0-1  #total = 2
      isolated: 2-8
    net:
      userLevelNetworking: true
# ...

The following command displays the status of the queues associated with a device:

Run this command on the node where the performance profile was applied.

$ ethtool -l <device>

The following command verifies the queue status before the profile is applied:

$ ethtool -l ens4

* `Combined`: Specifies the combined channel that shows the total count of reserved CPUs for _all_ supported devices is 2. This matches what is configured in the performance profile.

Example 2::
+
Example 2 demonstrates that the net queue count is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for _all_ supported network devices with a specific `vendorID`.

The relevant section from the performance profile is:

* `Combined`: Specifies that the total count of reserved CPUs for all supported devices with `vendorID=0x1af4` is 2. For example, if there is another network device `ens2` with `vendorID=0x1af4` it will also have total net queues of 2. This matches what is configured in the performance profile.

Example 3:: 
+
Example 3 shows that the net queue count is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for _all_ supported network devices that match any of the defined device identifiers. The command `udevadm info` provides a detailed report on a device. In this example the devices are:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# udevadm info -p /sys/class/net/ens4
...
E: ID_MODEL_ID=0x1000
E: ID_VENDOR_ID=0x1af4
E: INTERFACE=ens4

----

[source,terminal]
----
# udevadm info -p /sys/class/net/eth0
...
E: ID_MODEL_ID=0x1002
E: ID_VENDOR_ID=0x1001
E: INTERFACE=eth0
...
----
+
Set the net queues to 2 for a device with `interfaceName` equal to `eth0` and any devices that have a `vendorID=0x1af4` with the following performance profile:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]

apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2

      net:
        userLevelNetworking: true
        devices:
        - interfaceName = eth0
        - vendorID = 0x1af4
# ...

$ ethtool -l ens4

* `Combined`: Specifies that the total count of reserved CPUs for all supported devices with `vendorID=0x1af4` is set to 2.
+
For example, if there is another network device `ens2` with `vendorID=0x1af4`, it will also have the total net queues set to 2. Similarly, a device with `interfaceName` equal to `eth0` will have total net queues set to 2.
