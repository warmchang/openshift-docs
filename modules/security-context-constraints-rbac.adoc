= Role-based access to security context constraints

[role="_abstract"]
You can specify SCCs as resources that are handled by RBAC. This allows
you to scope access to your SCCs to a certain project or to the entire
cluster. Assigning users, groups, or service accounts directly to an
SCC retains cluster-wide scope.

include::snippets/default-projects.adoc[]

To include access to SCCs for your role, specify the `scc` resource
when creating a role.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create role <role-name> --verb=use --resource=scc --resource-name=<scc-name> -n <namespace>
----

This results in the following role definition:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
...
  name: role-name
  namespace: namespace
...
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - security.openshift.io
  resourceNames:
  - scc-name
  resources:
  - securitycontextconstraints
  verbs:
  - use
----

where::

`name`:: The name of the role.
`namespace`:: The namespace of the defined role. Defaults to `default` if not specified.
`apiGroups`:: The API group that includes the `SecurityContextConstraints` resource.
Automatically defined when `scc` is specified as a resource.
`resourceName`:: An example name for an SCC you want to have access.
`resources`:: The name of the resource group that allows users to specify SCC names in the `resourceNames` field.
`verbs`:: A list of verbs to apply to the role.

A local or cluster role with such a rule allows the subjects that are
bound to it with a role binding or a cluster role binding to use the
user-defined SCC called `scc-name`.

[NOTE]
====
Because RBAC is designed to prevent escalation, even project administrators
are unable to grant access to an SCC. By default, they are not
allowed to use the verb `use` on SCC resources, including the
`restricted-v2` SCC.
