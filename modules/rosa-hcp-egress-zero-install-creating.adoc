= Creating a Virtual Private Cloud for your {product-title} clusters

[role="_abstract"]
You must have a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create a {product-title} cluster. To pull images from the local ECR mirror over your VPC endpoint, you must configure a privatelink service connection and modify the default security groups with specific tags. Use one of the following methods to create a VPC:

* Create a VPC using the ROSA command-line interface (CLI)
* Create a VPC by using a Terraform template
* Create a VPC using the AWS CLI
* Manually create the VPC resources in the AWS console
