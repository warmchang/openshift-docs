= Network observability rules for health and performance

[role="_abstract"]
Network observability includes a system for managing Prometheus-based rules. Use these rules to monitor the health and performance of {product-title} applications and infrastructure.

The Network Observability Operator converts these rules into a `PrometheusRule` resource. The Network Observability Operator supports the following rule types:

* Alerting rules: Specifies rules managed by the Prometheus `AlertManager` to provide notification of network anomalies or infrastructure failures.
* Recording rules: Specifies pre-compute complex Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) expressions into new time series to improve dashboard performance and visualization.

View the `PrometheusRule` resource in the `netobserv` namespace by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get prometheusrules -n netobserv -o yaml
