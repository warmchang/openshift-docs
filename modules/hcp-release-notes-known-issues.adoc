This section includes several known issues for {product-title} {product-version}.

* If the annotation and the `ManagedCluster` resource name do not match, the {mce} console displays the cluster as `Pending import`. The cluster cannot be used by the {mce-short}. The same issue happens when there is no annotation and the `ManagedCluster` name does not match the `Infra-ID` value of the `HostedCluster` resource.

* When you use the {mce} console to add a new node pool to an existing hosted cluster, the same version of {product-title} might appear more than once in the list of options. You can select any instance in the list for the version that you want.

* When a node pool is scaled down to 0 workers, the list of hosts in the console still shows nodes in a `Ready` state. You can verify the number of nodes in two ways:

** In the console, go to the node pool and verify that it has 0 nodes.
** On the command-line interface, run the following commands:

*** Verify that 0 nodes are in the node pool by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodepool -A
----

*** Verify that 0 nodes are in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes --kubeconfig
----

*** Verify that 0 agents are reported as bound to the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get agents -A
----

* When you create a hosted cluster in an environment that uses the dual-stack network, you might encounter pods stuck in the `ContainerCreating` state. This issue occurs because the `openshift-service-ca-operator` resource cannot generate the `metrics-tls` secret that the DNS pods need for DNS resolution. As a result, the pods cannot resolve the Kubernetes API server. To resolve this issue, configure the DNS server settings for a dual stack network.

* If you created a hosted cluster in the same namespace as its managed cluster, detaching the managed hosted cluster deletes everything in the managed cluster namespace including the hosted cluster. The following situations can create a hosted cluster in the same namespace as its managed cluster:

** You created a hosted cluster on the Agent platform through the {mce} console by using the default hosted cluster cluster namespace.
** You created a hosted cluster through the command-line interface or API by specifying the hosted cluster namespace to be the same as the hosted cluster name.

* When you use the console or API to specify an IPv6 address for the `spec.services.servicePublishingStrategy.nodePort.address` field of a hosted cluster, a full IPv6 address with 8 hextets is required. For example, instead of specifying `2620:52:0:1306::30`, you need to specify `2620:52:0:1306:0:0:0:30`.

* In {hcp} on {VirtProductName}, if you store all hosted cluster information in a shared namespace and then back up and restore a hosted cluster, you might unintentionally change other hosted clusters. To avoid this issue, back up and restore only hosted clusters that use labels, or avoid storing all hosted cluster information in a shared namespace.
