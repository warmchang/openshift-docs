= Network Observability Operator 1.11 new features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
Learn about the new features and enhancements in the Network Observability Operator 1.11 release, including hierarchical governance with the `FlowCollectorSlice` resource, a new Service deployment model, and the general availability of health rules.

Per-tenant hierarchical governance with the FlowCollectorSlice resource::
This release introduces the `FlowCollectorSlice` API to support hierarchical governance, allowing project administrators to independently manage sampling and subnet labeling for their specific namespaces.
+
This feature was implemented to reduce global processing overhead and provide tenant autonomy in large-scale environments where individual teams require self-service visibility without cluster-wide configuration changes. As a result, organizations can selectively collect traffic and delegate data enrichment tasks to the project level while maintaining centralized cluster control.

New Service deployment model for the `FlowCollector` resource::
This release introduces a new `Service` deployment model in the `FlowCollector` custom resource. This model provides an intermediate option between the `Direct` and `Kafka` models. In the `Service` model, the eBPF agent is deployed as a `daemon` set, and the `flowlogs-pipeline` component is deployed as a scalable service.
+
This model offers improved performance in large clusters by reducing cache duplication across component instances.

Health rules are generally available::
The health alerts feature, introduced in previous versions as a Technology Preview feature, is fully supported as health rules in the Network Observability Operator 1.11 release.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Network Observability health rules are available on {product-title} 4.16 and later.
====
+
This eBPF-based system correlates network metrics with infrastructure metadata to provide proactive notifications and automated insights into cluster health, such as traffic surges or latency trends. As a result, you can use the *Network Health* dashboard in the {product-title} web console to manage categorized alerts, customize thresholds, and create recording rules for improved visualization performance.

Enhanced network traffic visualization and filtering::
This release introduces enhanced visualization and filtering tools in the {product-title} web console.

* Inline filter editing: You can now edit filter chips directly within the filter input field. This enhancement provides a more efficient method for modifying long filter values that were previously truncated, eliminating the need to manually copy and paste values. This update adopts an inline editing convention consistent with the Saved filters feature.
* External traffic quick filters: New quick filters allow you to monitor external ingress and egress traffic actively. This enhancement streamlines network management, enabling you to identify and address issues related to external network communication quickly.
* Intuitive resource iconography: The {product-title} console now uses specific icons for Kubernetes kinds, groups, and filters. These icons provide a more intuitive and visually consistent experience, making it easier to navigate the network topology and identify applied filters at a glance.

DNS resolution analysis::
This release includes eBPF-based DNS tracking to enrich network flow records with domain names.
+
This feature was implemented to reduce the mean time to identify (MTTI) by allowing administrators to immediately distinguish between network routing failures and service discovery issues, such as `NXDOMAIN` errors.

Integration with Gateway API::
This release introduces automatic integration between the Network Observability Operator and the Gateway API when a `GatewayClass` resource is created. This feature provides high-level traffic attribution for cluster ingress and egress traffic without requiring manual configuration of the `FlowCollector` resource.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Integration with Gateway API is available on {product-title} 4.19 and later.
====
+
You can verify the automated mapping of network flows to Gateway API resources in the *Observe* -> *Network Traffic* view of the {product-title} web console. The *Owner* column displays the Gateway name, providing a direct link to the associated Gateway resource page.

Improved data resilience in the Overview and Topology views::
With this release, functional data remains visible in the *Overview* and *Topology* views even if some background queries fail. This enhancement ensures that the scope and group drop-down menus in the Topology view remain accessible during partial service disruptions.
+
Additionally, the *Overview* page now displays active error messages to assist with troubleshooting, providing better visibility into system health without interrupting the monitoring workflow.

Improved categorization of unknown network flows::
With this release, network flows from unknown sources are categorized into four distinct groups: external, unknown service, unknown node, and unknown pod.
+
This enhancement uses subnet labels to separate unknown IP subnets, providing a clearer network topology. This improved visibility helps to identify potential security threats and allows for a more targeted analysis of unknown elements within the cluster.

Improved performance for new Network Observability installations::
The default performance of the Network Observability Operator is improved for new installations. The default value for `cacheActiveTimeout` is increased from 5 to 15 seconds, and the `cacheMaxFlows` value is increased from 100,000 to 120,000 to accommodate higher flow volumes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
These new default values apply only to new installations; existing installations retain their current configurations.
====
+
These changes reduce CPU load by up to 40%.

Improved LokiStack status monitoring and reporting::
With this release, the Network Observability Operator monitors the status of the `LokiStack` resource and reports errors or configuration issues. The Network Observability Operator verifies `LokiStack` conditions, including pending or failed pods and specific warning conditions.
+
This enhancement provides more actionable information in the `FlowCollector` status, allowing for more effective troubleshooting of the `LokiStack` component within network observability.

Visual indicators for Loki indexed fields in the filter menu::
With this release, functional data remains visible in the *Overview* and *Topology* views even if some background queries fail. This enhancement ensures that the scope and group drop-down menus in the Topology view remain accessible during partial service disruptions.
+
This enhancement improves query performance by indicating which fields are indexed for faster data retrieval. Using indexed fields when filtering data reduces the time required to browse and analyze network flows within the console.
