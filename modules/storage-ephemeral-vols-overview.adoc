= Overview of generic ephemeral volumes

[role="_abstract"]
To manage scratch data by using standard storage drivers, use generic ephemeral volumes. These volumes provide per-pod directories similar to `emptyDir` volumes but work with any driver that supports persistent volumes and dynamic provisioning, so that you can leverage existing storage infrastructure for temporary needs.

Generic ephemeral volumes are specified inline in the pod specification and follow the lifecycle of a pod. They are created and deleted along with the pod.

Generic ephemeral volumes have the following features:

* Storage can be local or network-attached.

* Volumes can have a fixed size that pods cannot exceed.

* Volumes might have some initial data, depending on the driver and parameters.

* Typical operations on volumes are supported, assuming that the driver supports them, including snapshotting, cloning, resizing, and storage capacity tracking.

[NOTE]
====
Generic ephemeral volumes do not support offline snapshotting and resizing.

Due to this limitation, the following Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers do not support the following features for generic ephemeral volumes:

* Azure Disk CSI driver does not support resize.

* Cinder CSI driver does not support snapshot.
