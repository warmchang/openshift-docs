= Assisted Service

The Assisted Service is deployed with the multicluster engine and {rh-rhacm-first}.

[NOTE]
====
The following numbers are estimated.
Tune the values for more accurate results.
Add an engineering margin, for example +20%, to the results to account for potential estimation inaccuracies.
