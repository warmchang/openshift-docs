= Configuring storage throughput for gp3 drives

[role="_abstract"]
You can improve performance for high traffic services by increasing the throughput of gp3 storage volumes in an {aws-short} cluster.
You can configure the storage throughput by editing your compute or control plane machine set.

.Prerequisites

* You use gp3 storage volume(s).

.Procedure
* Add or edit the following lines under the `providerSpec` field in your compute or control plane machine set:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    blockDevices:
      - ebs:
          throughputMib: <throughput_value>
----
where:

`<throughput_value>`::
Specifies a value in MiB per second between 125 and 2,000.
You can only edit this value on gp3 volumes.
The default value is `125`.
