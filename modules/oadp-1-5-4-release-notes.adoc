== Known issues

Simultaneous updates to the same `NonAdminBackupStorageLocationRequest` objects cause resource conflicts::

Simultaneous updates by several controllers or processes to the same `NonAdminBackupStorageLocationRequest` objects cause resource conflicts during backup creation in {oadp-short} self-service. As a consequence, reconciliation attempts fail with `object has been modified` errors. No known workaround exists.
