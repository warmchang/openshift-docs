= Creating a cluster-scoped network to connect pods directly to an external network

[role="_abstract"]
You can connect one or more projects to a physical network for direct layer 2 access to data center resources through a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource in the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, go to *Virtualization* -> *Networking*. 
. Click *Virtual machine networks* in the navigation pane.
. Click *Create*. The *Create virtual machine network* wizard is displayed.
. Give details about the network on the *Network definition* page:
.. Enter a name for the network in the *Name* field.
.. Select a physical network through an `OpenvSwitch` bridge from the *Select physical network* list.
.. Enter the maximum transmission unit (MTU).
+
[NOTE]
====
An MTU, measured in bytes, is the largest allowable size of a data packet. Ensure that all underlying physical network equipment supports this MTU, or higher.
====
.. Optional: Select the *VLAN ID* checkbox to enter VLAN tagging information. If you tag traffic with a VLAN ID, you must configure your physical switch with a VLAN trunk that includes the VLAN ID that you choose.
. Click *Next*.
. Select the projects that the network should be made available to on the *Project mapping* page. By default, all projects have access to the network.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification

. Navigate to the *Virtualization* -> *Virtual machine networks* page.
. Click the *OVN localnet* tab.
. Verify that your new network is displayed in the list.
