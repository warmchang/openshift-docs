= Image limits

[role="_abstract"]
After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that an image can consume.

An image can consume the following resources:

* Storage
* `openshift.io/Image`

The following table shows the supported constraints for an image. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each image.

.Image limits
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Constraint |Behavior

|`Max`
|`image.dockerimagemetadata.size` less than or equal to `Max[<resource>]`
|===

[NOTE]
====
To prevent blobs that exceed the limit from being uploaded to the registry, you must configure the registry to enforce quota. The `REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA` environment variable must be set to `true`. By default, the environment variable is set to `true` for new deployments.
