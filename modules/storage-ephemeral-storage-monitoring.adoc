= Monitoring ephemeral storage

[role="_abstract"]
To monitor ephemeral storage usage, use the `/bin/df` utility. By using this tool, you can track disk space consumption on the volumes where ephemeral container data resides, specifically `/var/lib/kubelet` and `/var/lib/containers`.

When you use the `df` command, the available space for only `/var/lib/kubelet` is shown if `/var/lib/containers` is placed on a separate disk by the cluster administrator.

.Procedure

* To show the human-readable values of used and available space in `/var/lib`, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]

$ df -h /var/lib

The output shows the ephemeral storage usage in `/var/lib`:
