= LVMS deployment

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure local storage is ready for use, {microshift-short} automatically deploys LVMS into the `openshift-storage` namespace at startup. This automated process prepares the node for storage operations immediately, eliminating the need for manual installation.

LVMS uses `StorageCapacity` tracking to ensure that pods with an LVMS PVC are not scheduled if the requested storage is greater than the free storage of the volume group. For more information about `StorageCapacity` tracking, see "Storage Capacity".
