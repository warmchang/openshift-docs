= Filtering eBPF flow data using multiple rules

[role="_abstract"]
Configure multiple filtering rules in the `FlowCollector` custom resource to refine network traffic data collection by accepting or rejecting specific eBPF flows based on IP addresses and packet conditions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* You cannot use duplicate Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDRs) in filter rules.
* When an IP address matches multiple filter rules, the rule with the most specific CIDR prefix (longest prefix) takes precedence.
