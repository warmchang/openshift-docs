= {op-system-base} KVM on {ibm-z-title} host recommendations

[role="_abstract"]
To optimize Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) performance on {ibm-z-title}, apply host recommendations. Because optimal settings depend strongly on specific workloads and available resources, finding the best balance for your {op-system-base} environment often requires experimentation to avoid adverse effects.

The following sections introduces some best practices when using {product-title} with {op-system-base} KVM on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} environments.
