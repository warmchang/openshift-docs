= About Hyper-Threading for low latency and real-time applications

[role="_abstract"]
To improve system throughput for parallel workloads, you can use Hyper-Threading to enable a physical CPU core to function as two logical cores, executing independent threads simultaneously. The default {product-title} configuration expects Hyper-Threading to be enabled.

For telecommunications applications, design your application infrastructure to minimize latency as much as possible. Hyper-Threading can slow performance times and negatively affect throughput for compute-intensive workloads that require low latency. Disabling Hyper-Threading ensures predictable performance and can decrease processing times for these workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Hyper-Threading implementation and configuration differs depending on the hardware you are running {product-title} on. Consult the relevant host hardware tuning information for more details of the Hyper-Threading implementation specific to that hardware. Disabling Hyper-Threading can increase the cost per core of the cluster.
