= Performance optimization with recording rules

[role="_abstract"]
For large-scale clusters, recording rules optimize how Prometheus handles network data. Recording rules improve dashboard responsiveness and reduce the computational overhead of complex queries.

[id="network-observability-recording-rules-benefits_{context}"]
== Optimization benefits
Recording rules pre-compute complex Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) expressions and save the results as new time series. Unlike alerting rules, recording rules do not monitor thresholds.

Using recording rules provides the following advantages:

Improved performance:: Pre-computing Prometheus queries allows dashboards to load faster by avoiding on-demand calculations for long-term trends.
Resource efficiency:: Calculating data at fixed intervals reduces CPU load on the Prometheus server compared to recalculating data on every dashboard refresh.
Simplified queries:: Using short metric names, such as `cluster:network_traffic:rate_5m`, simplifies complex aggregate calculations in custom dashboards.
