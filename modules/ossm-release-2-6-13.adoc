== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the `Kiali` Custom Resource (CR) went temporarily to an invalid state after switching Service Mesh Control Plane (SMCP) from `MultiTenant` to `ClusterWide` mode. As a consequence, there was a brief service disruption for users. With this release, the changes in `accessible_namespaces` and `cluster_wide_access` settings when updating from `MultiTenant` to `ClusterWide` avoid the temporary invalid state of `Kiali` CR, ensuring a smoother transition.

* Before this update, the `must-gather` command failed due to the lack of `rsync` and `tar` tools. As a consequence, users were unable to gather information from the cluster. With this release, the `must-gather` command now uses alternative tools for data collection. As a result, the command successfully downloads data, improving cluster information retrieval.
