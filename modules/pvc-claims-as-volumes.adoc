= Claims as volumes

[role="_abstract"]
To enable pods to access storage resources, configure Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) as volumes. By mounting the claim to the host and into the pod, the cluster locates the backing `PersistentVolume` (PV) in the same namespace, ensuring the workload can read and write data effectively.

Claims use the same conventions as volumes when requesting storage with specific access modes.

Claims, such as pods, can request specific quantities of a resource. In this case, the request is for storage. The same resource model applies to volumes and claims.

.Mount volume to the host and into the pod example
[source,yaml]

kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend

      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"

where:

`volumeMounts.mountPath`:: Specifies the path to mount the volume inside the pod.

`volumeMounts.name`:: Specifies the name of the volume to mount. Do not mount to the container root, `/`, or any path that is the same in the host and the container. This can corrupt your host system if the container is sufficiently privileged, such as the host `/dev/pts` files. Using `/host` is a safe option for mounting the host.

`persistentVolumeClaim.claimName`:: Specifies the name of the PVC, that exists in the same namespace, to use.
