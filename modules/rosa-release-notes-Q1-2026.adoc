ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
* **Platform monitoring using the Cluster Monitoring Operator.** You can now configure the in-cluster monitoring stack components, metrics, and alerts to monitor both core platform components and user-defined projects. Previously, you could only monitor user-defined projects. This change applies to both new and existing {product-title} clusters. However, it affects them differently.
+
** For new clusters created after this change, the default, in-cluster monitoring stack is installed during cluster installation and immediately begins collecting metrics. After installation, you can use the default configuration, or you can modify the monitoring components to suit your needs.
** For existing clusters created prior to this change, no changes will be made to the cluster's monitoring configuration. However, you can begin to use the core platform monitoring components, and modify them to suit your needs.
