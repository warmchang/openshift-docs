[id="js-failure-policy_{context}"]
= Failure policy configuration for {js-operator}

[role="_abstract"]
To control workload behavior in response to child job failures, you can configure a JobSet failure policy. This enables you to define specific actions, such as restarting or failing the entire JobSet, based on the failure reason or the specific replicated job affected.

[id="jobset-failure-policy-actions_{context}"]
== Failure policy actions

These actions are available when a job failure matches a defined rule.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Action | Description

| `FailJobSet`
| Marks the entire JobSet as failed immediately.

| `RestartJobSet`
| Restarts the JobSet by recreating all child jobs. This action counts toward the `maxRestarts` limit. This is the default action if no rules match.

| `RestartJobSetAndIgnoreMaxRestarts`
| Restarts the JobSet without counting toward the `maxRestarts` limit.
|===

[id="jobset-rule-attributes_{context}"]
== Rule-targeting attributes

Use the following attributes to define failure rules.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Attribute | Description

| `targetReplicatedJobs`
| Specifies which replicated jobs trigger the rule.

| `onJobFailureReasons`
| Triggers the rule based on the specific job failure reason. Valid values include `BackoffLimitExceeded`, `DeadlineExceeded`, and `PodFailurePolicy`.

[id="jobset-rule-config-example_{context}"]
== Configuration example

This configuration marks the JobSet as failed if the `leader` job fails.
