= Creating object count quotas

[role="_abstract"]
To manage the consumption of standard namespaced resource types, create an object count quota. By creating an object count quota within a {product-title} project, you can set defined limits on the number of objects, such as `BuildConfig` and `DeploymentConfig` objects.

When you use a resource quota, {product-title} charges an object against the quota if the object exists in server storage. These quotas protect against exhaustion of storage resources.

.Procedure

. To configure an object count quota for a resource, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create quota <name> --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>,count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>
----
+
.Example showing object count quota
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create quota test --hard=count/deployments.extensions=2,count/replicasets.extensions=4,count/pods=3,count/secrets=4
resourcequota "test" created
----

. To inspect the detailed status of the object count quota, use the following `oc describe` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe quota test
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Name:                         test
Namespace:                    quota
Resource                      Used  Hard
--------                      ----  ----
count/deployments.extensions  0     2
count/pods                    0     3
count/replicasets.extensions  0     4
count/secrets                 0     4
----
+
This example limits the listed resources to the hard limit in each project in the cluster.
