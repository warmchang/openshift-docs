= Machine config pools

[role="_abstract"]
To apply performance profiles to specific nodes, associate them with a machine config pool (MCP). The MCP tracks the status of tuning updates, such as kernel arguments, huge pages, and real-time kernels, ensuring your cluster configurations are applied correctly.

The Performance Profile controller monitors changes in the MCP and updates the performance profile status accordingly.

The only conditions returned by the MCP to the performance profile status is when the MCP is `Degraded`, which leads to `performanceProfile.status.condition.Degraded = true`.

.Procedure

. Check the state of the associated machine config pool by entering the following command. The output example shows a performance profile with an associated machine config pool (`worker-cnf`) that is in a degraded state.

. To check the reason for the degraded state, enter the following command, ensuring that you change the example machine config pool with your machine config pool. The `describe` section of the MCP shows the reason.

. Optional: You can also run the `oc describe` command against the performance profile to check the degraded state status. The example output shows the performance profile `status` field marked as `degraded = true`:
