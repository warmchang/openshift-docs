= Quota scopes

[role="_abstract"]
To restrict the set of resources that a quota applies to, add associated scopes. This configuration limits usage measurement to the intersection of the enumerated scopes, ensuring that specifying a resource outside the allowed set results in a validation error.

|Scope |Description

|`Terminating`
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds >= 0`.

|`NotTerminating`
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` is `nil`.

|`BestEffort`
|Match pods that have best effort quality of service for either `cpu` or `memory`.

|`NotBestEffort`
|Match pods that do not have best effort quality of service for `cpu` and `memory`.
|===

A `BestEffort` scope restricts a quota to limiting the following resources:

* pods

A `Terminating`, `NotTerminating`, and `NotBestEffort` scope restricts a quota to tracking the following resources:

* `pods`
* `memory`
* `requests.memory`
* `limits.memory`
* `cpu`
* `requests.cpu`
* `limits.cpu`
* `ephemeral-storage`
* `requests.ephemeral-storage`
* `limits.ephemeral-storage`

[NOTE]
====
Ephemeral storage requests and limits apply only if you enabled the ephemeral storage technology preview. This feature is disabled by default.
