= Troubleshooting issue where backup CR cannot retrieve volume

[role="_abstract"]
Resolve the `InvalidVolume.NotFound` error that occurs when the persistent volume (PV) and snapshot locations are in different regions. This helps you ensure the `Backup` CR can successfully retrieve volumes.

If the PV and the snapshot locations are in different regions, the `Backup` custom resource (CR) displays the following error message:

[source,text]
----
InvalidVolume.NotFound: The volume vol-xxxx does not exist.
----

.Procedure

. Edit the value of the `spec.snapshotLocations.velero.config.region` key in the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest so that the snapshot location is in the same region as the PV.

. Create a new `Backup` CR.
