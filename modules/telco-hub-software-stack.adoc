|The version aligned with the {rh-rhacm} release.
|====
. This table will be updated when the aligned {rh-rhacm} version (2.16) is released.

. This table will be updated when the aligned {odf-short} version (4.21) is released.

. This is a platform-agnostic Operator. Its support lifecycle does not extend to the full lifecycle of {product-title}. With all platform agnostic Operators, customers need to anticipate the need to update to a newer minor version of the Operator at the end of the Operator lifecycle of the current version or when planning to update the {product-title} cluster to stay supported. While a given Operator minor version may not support the latest available {product-title} release, there will always be a version of the Operator available for every supported version of {product-title} at any given point in time. For terms of support, see the Platform Agnostic Operators section of link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].
