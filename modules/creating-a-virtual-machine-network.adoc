= Creating a virtual machine network from a physical network

[role="_abstract"]
If your use case does not permit the use of network address translation (NAT), you can give VMs direct layer 2 access by creating a VM network that uses a physical network.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title} web console, go to *Networking* -> *Physical networks*.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the network that you want to edit.
. Click *Create a virtual machines network using this physical network*. The *Create virtual machine network* wizard is displayed with the network name populated.
. Select a *Physical network*.
. Optional: Select *VLAN tagging* and enter a *VLAN ID*.
. On the *Project mapping* page, define which projects can access this network.
. Click *Create*.
