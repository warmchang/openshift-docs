= Expanding a {product-title} physical network to include new nodes

[role="_abstract"]
You can add one or more {product-title} worker nodes to an existing physical network if you want to expand access to that network.
Expanding a physical network creates a new configuration under the same logical physical network.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure
. From the *Virtualization* perspective, go to *Networking* -> *Physical networks*.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the network that you want to edit.
. Click *Configure nodes*. The *Network configuration wizard* is displayed.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Physical network name* is predefined. You cannot edit it during this process.
====
. Click *Next*.
. On the *Nodes configuration* page, select either *Apply to all nodes on the cluster* or *Apply to specific subsets of nodes using the nodes selector*.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you select specific nodes, you can view the matching nodes list to ensure the selection is correct. A validation error is displayed if the selected nodes overlap with another configuration associated with the same network.
====
. On the *Uplink connection* page, select the network interface to connect to the physical network:
+
Default node network:: Uses the default node network to access the outside physical network.
A single interface:: Select a specific physical network interface from the list.
+
[WARNING]
====
If the selected secondary interface has an IP address on some of the nodes, using removes the IP address and might disrupt network services.
====
Bonding interface:: Configures bonded network interfaces to achieve resilience and higher throughput.
.. Enter a *Bonding name*.
.. Select the *Network interfaces* to bond.
+
[NOTE]
====
The system displays only the interfaces that all nodes have in common.
====
.. Select the *Aggregation mode* from the drop down options.
. On the *Settings* page, enter a *Bridge name* and set the *Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)*.
. Review the configuration details.
. Click *Create*.
