= What to consider when choosing an update channel

[role="_abstract"]
Choosing the appropriate update channel for your cluster involves two decisions.

First, select the minor version you want for your cluster update. Selecting a channel which matches your current version ensures that you only apply z-stream updates and do not receive feature updates. Selecting an available channel which has a version greater than your current version will ensure that after one or more updates your cluster will have updated to that version. Your cluster will only be offered channels which match its current version, the next version, or the next EUS version.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the complexity involved in planning updates between versions many minors apart, channels that assist in planning updates beyond a single Control Plane Only update are not offered.

Second, you should choose your desired rollout strategy. You may choose to update as soon as Red{nbsp}Hat declares a release GA by selecting from fast channels or you may want to wait for Red{nbsp}Hat to promote releases to the stable channel. Update recommendations offered in the `fast-{product-version}` and `stable-{product-version}` are both fully supported and benefit equally from ongoing data analysis. The promotion delay before promoting a release to the stable channel represents the only difference between the two channels. Updates to the latest z-streams are generally promoted to the stable channel within a week or two, however the delay when initially rolling out updates to the latest minor is much longer, generally 45-90 days. Please consider the promotion delay when choosing your desired channel, as waiting for promotion to the stable channel may affect your scheduling plans.

Additionally, there are several factors which may lead an organization to move clusters to the fast channel either permanently or temporarily including the following:

* The desire to apply a specific fix known to affect your environment without delay.
* Application of CVE fixes without delay. CVE fixes may introduce regressions, so promotion delays still apply to z-streams with CVE fixes.
* Internal testing processes. If it takes your organization several weeks to qualify releases it is best test concurrently with our promotion process rather than waiting. This also assures that any telemetry signal provided to Red{nbsp}Hat is a factored into our rollout, so issues relevant to you can be fixed faster.
