= Update recommendations and Conditional Updates

[role="_abstract"]
Red{nbsp}Hat monitors newly released versions and update paths associated with those versions before and after they are added to supported channels.

If Red Hat removes update recommendations from any supported release, a superseding update recommendation will be provided to a future version that corrects the regression. There may however be a delay while the defect is corrected, tested, and promoted to your selected channel.

Beginning in {product-title} 4.10, when update risks are confirmed, they are declared as Conditional Update risks for the relevant updates. Each known risk may apply to all clusters or only clusters matching certain conditions. Some examples include having the `Platform` set to `None` or the CNI provider set to `OpenShiftSDN`. The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) continually evaluates known risks against the current cluster state. If no risks match, the update is recommended. If the risk matches, those update paths are labeled as _updates with known issues_, and a reference link to the known issues is provided. The reference link helps the cluster admin decide if they want to accept the risk and continue to update their cluster.

When Red{nbsp}Hat chooses to declare Conditional Update risks, that action is taken in all relevant channels simultaneously. Declaration of a Conditional Update risk may happen either before or after the update has been promoted to supported channels.
