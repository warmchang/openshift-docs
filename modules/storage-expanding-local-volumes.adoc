= Expanding local volumes

[role="_abstract"]
You can manually expand persistent volumes (PVs) and persistent volume claims (PVCs) created by using the local storage operator (LSO).

.Procedure

. Expand the underlying devices. Ensure that appropriate capacity is available on these devices.

. Update the corresponding PV objects to match the new device sizes by editing the `.spec.capacity` field of the PV.

. For the storage class that is used for binding the PVC to PV, set the `allowVolumeExpansion` field to `true`.

. For the PVC, set the `.spec.resources.requests.storage` field to match the new size.
+
Kubelet automatically expands the underlying file system on the volume, if necessary, and updates the status field of the PVC to reflect the new size.
