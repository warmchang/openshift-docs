= Network Observability Operator 1.11 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability Operator 1.11 release contains several fixed issues that improve performance and the user experience.

Missing dates in charts::
Before this update, the chart tooltip date was not displayed as intended, due to a breaking change in a dependency. As a consequence, users experienced missing date information in the {product-title} web console plugin's *Overview* tab chart, affecting data context.
+
With this release, the chart tooltip date display is restored.

Warning message for Direct mode not refreshed after upscaling::
Before this update, cluster information was not refreshed after scaling, causing a warning message to persist in large clusters, not updating with changes.
+
With this release, cluster information is now refreshed when it changes, resulting in the warning message for large clusters in `Direct` mode updating with changes in cluster size, improving user visibility.

Unenriched OVN IPs::
Before this update, some IPs declared by OVN-Kubernetes were not enriched, causing unenriched IPs like `100.64.0.x` to not appear in `Machines` network. As a consequence, IPs not enriched caused the wrong network visibility for users.
+
With this release, missing IPs in OVN-Kubernetes are now enriched. As a result, IPs declared by OVN-Kubernetes are correctly enriched and appear in the `Machines` network improving the visibility of network traffic sources in the `Machines` network.

Improved operator API discovery reliability::
Before this update, a race condition during Network Observability Operator startup could cause API discovery to fail silently. As a consequence, the operator could fail to recognize the {product-title} cluster, leading to missing mandatory `ClusterRoleBinding` resources and preventing components from functioning correctly.
+
With this release, the Network Observability Operator continues to check for API availability over time and reconciliation is blocked if discovery fails. As a result, the operator correctly identifies the environment and ensures all required roles are created.

Added missing translation fields to IPFIX exports::
Before this update, some network flow fields were missing translations during the IPFIX export process. As a result, exported IPFIX data was incomplete or difficult to interpret in external collectors.
+
With this release, the missing translation fields (xlat) have been added to the `flowlogs-pipeline` IPFIX exporter. IPFIX exports now provide a complete set of translated fields for consistent network observability.
+

Fixed FlowMetric form creation link and defaults::
Before this update, the link to create a `FlowMetric` custom resource incorrectly directed users to a YAML editor instead of the intended form view. Additionally, the editor was pre-filled with incorrect default values.
+
With this release, the link correctly leads to the `FlowMetric` resource creation form with the expected default settings. As a result, users can now easily create `FlowMetric` resources through the user interface.
+

Virtual machine resource type icon in Topology view::
Before this update, virtual machine (VM) owner types incorrectly displayed a generic question mark (?) icon in the *Topology* view.
+
With this release, the user interface now includes a specific icon for VM resources. As a result, users can more easily identify and distinguish VM traffic within the network topology.
+

DNS optimization, update DNS Alerts::
Before this update, many DNS "NXDOMAIN" errors were returned due to ambiguous URLs being used in network observability.
+
With this release, these URLs have been disambiguated, resulting in a more optimal use of DNS.

Follow this format:

MetricName and Remap fields are validated::
+
Before this update, users could create a `FlowMetric` custom resource (CR) with an invalid metric name. Although the `FlowMetric` CR was successfully created, the underlying metric would fail silently without providing any error feedback to the user.
+
With this release, the `FlowMetric`, `metricName`, and `remap` fields are now validated before creation, so users are immediately notified if they enter an invalid name.
