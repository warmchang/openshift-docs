= Configuring quota synchronization period

[role="_abstract"]
To control the synchronization time frame when resources are deleted, configure the `resource-quota-sync-period` setting. This parameter in the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file determines how frequently the system updates usage statistics to reflect deleted resources.

[NOTE]
====
Before quota usage is restored, you might encounter problems when attempting to reuse the resources.
====

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and determining resource usage when automation is used.

[NOTE]
====
The `resource-quota-sync-period` setting balances system performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on the controller.
====

.Procedure

. To specify the time required for resources to regenerate and become available again, edit the `resource-quota-sync-period` setting. With this configuration, you can set the synchronization interval in seconds.
