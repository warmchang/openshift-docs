= Collecting low latency tuning debugging data for Red Hat Support

[role="_abstract"]
To debug low latency setup issues when opening a support case, collect diagnostic information for Red Hat Support using the `must-gather` tool. This command gathers essential data, such as node tuning and NUMA topology, from your {product-title} cluster.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title} and low latency tuning.

Use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command to collect the following information about your cluster, including features and objects associated with low latency tuning:

* The Node Tuning Operator namespaces and child objects.
* `MachineConfigPool` and associated `MachineConfig` objects.
* The Node Tuning Operator and associated Tuned objects.
* Linux kernel command-line options.
* CPU and NUMA topology
* Basic PCI device information and NUMA locality.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The {product-title} {oc-first} installed.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Collect debugging information by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather

. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was created in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather-local.5421342344627712289//
----
** `must-gather-local.5421342344627712289//`: Replace this value with the directory name created by the `must-gather` tool.
+
[NOTE]
====
Create a compressed file to attach the data to a support case or to use with the Performance Profile Creator wrapper script when you create a performance profile.
====

. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
