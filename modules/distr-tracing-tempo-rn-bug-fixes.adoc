The {TempoShortName} 3.9 release fixes the following issues.

Fixed network policies for managed OpenShift services::
Before this update, the Operator network policies used a hard-coded port 6443 for the API server. As a consequence, the Operator failed to connect to managed OpenShift services that expose the API on port 443. With this update, the Operator dynamically retrieves the control plane address from service endpoints. As a result, network policies work correctly on all OpenShift environments.

CVE-2025-61726::
Before this update, a flaw existed in the `net/url` package in the Go standard library. As a consequence, a denial-of-service HTTP request with a massive number of query parameters could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory and eventually become unresponsive. This release eliminates this flaw.

CVE-2025-61729::
Before this update, the `HostnameError.Error()` function in the Go `crypto/x509` package used string concatenation in a loop without limiting the number of printed hostnames. As a consequence, processing a malicious certificate with many hostnames could cause excessive CPU and memory consumption, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This release includes the fix for this flaw.

CVE-2025-68121::
Before this update, a flaw existed in the `crypto/tls` package in the Go standard library. As a consequence, during TLS session resumption, unauthorized clients or servers could bypass certificate validation if CA pools were mutated between handshakes. This release includes the fix for this flaw.
