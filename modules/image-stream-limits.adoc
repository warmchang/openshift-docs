= Image stream limits

[role="_abstract"]
After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that an image stream can consume.

An image stream can consume the following resources:

* `openshift.io/image-tags`
* `openshift.io/images`
* `openshift.io/ImageStream`

The `openshift.io/image-tags` resource represents unique stream limits. Possible references are an `ImageStreamTag`, an `ImageStreamImage`, or a `DockerImage`. You can use the `oc tag` and `oc import-image` commands or use image stream to create tags. No distinction exists between internal and external references. However, each unique reference that is tagged in an image stream specification is counted only once. The reference does not restrict pushes to an internal container image registry in any way, but the reference is useful for tag restriction.

The `openshift.io/images` resource represents unique image names that are recorded in image stream status. The resource helps restrict the number of images that can be pushed to the internal registry. Internal and external references are not distinguished.

The following table shows the supported constraints for an image stream. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each image stream.

|===
|Constraint |Behavior

|`Max[openshift.io/image-tags]`
|`length( uniqueimagetags( imagestream.spec.tags ) )` less than or equal to `Max[openshift.io/image-tags]`

`uniqueimagetags` returns unique references to images of given spec tags.

|`Max[openshift.io/images]`
|`length( uniqueimages( imagestream.status.tags ) )` less than or equal to `Max[openshift.io/images]`

`uniqueimages` returns unique image names found in status tags. The name is equal to the digest for the image.
