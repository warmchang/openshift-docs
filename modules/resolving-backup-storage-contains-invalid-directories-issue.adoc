= Resolving invalid directories in backup storage

[role="_abstract"]
Resolve the `Backup storage contains invalid top-level directories` error that occurs when object storage contains non-Velero directories. This helps you configure the correct bucket prefix for shared object storage.


.Procedure

* If the object storage is not dedicated to Velero, you must specify a prefix for the bucket by setting the `spec.backupLocations.velero.objectStorage.prefix` parameter in the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest.
