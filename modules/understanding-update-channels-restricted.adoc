If you manage the container images for your {product-title} clusters yourself, you must consult the Red{nbsp}Hat errata that is associated with product releases and note any comments that impact updates.

During an update, the user interface might warn you about switching between these versions, so you must ensure that you selected an appropriate version before you bypass those warnings.
