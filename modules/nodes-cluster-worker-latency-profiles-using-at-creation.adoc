= Implementing worker latency profiles at cluster creation

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure cluster stability in high latency environments, implement worker latency profiles during cluster creation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To edit the configuration of the installation program, first use the command `openshift-install create manifests` to create the default node manifest and other manifest YAML files. This file structure must exist before you can add `workerLatencyProfile`. The platform on which you are installing might have varying requirements. Refer to the Installing section of the documentation for your specific platform.
====

.Procedure

. Create the manifest that is needed to build the cluster by using a folder name appropriate for your installation.

. Create a YAML file to define `config.node`. The file must be in the `manifests` directory.

. When defining `workerLatencyProfile` in the manifest for the first time, specify any of the profiles at cluster creation time: `Default`, `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` or `LowUpdateSlowReaction`.

.Verification

* View the manifest file by running the following command. The output of the command should show the creation of the `spec.workerLatencyProfile` `Default` value in the manifest file.

$ openshift-install create manifests --dir=<cluster_install_dir>

* `<cluster_install_dir>`: Specifies the directory where you installed your cluster. 

* Edit the manifest and add the value by entering the following command. The following example command uses the `vi` editor to show an example manifest file with the "Default" `workerLatencyProfile` value added.

[source,terminal]
----
$ vi <cluster_install_dir>/manifests/config-node-default-profile.yaml

* `<cluster_install_dir>`: Specifies the directory where you installed your cluster.
