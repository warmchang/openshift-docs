= Configuring an htpasswd identity provider with the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can create an htpasswd identity provider (IDP) with the OCM CLI (`ocm`) tool.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured the latest version of the OCM CLI (`ocm`).

.Procedure

* Run the following command to create an htpasswd IDP by passing the usernames and passwords in the command-line interface:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm create idp --type htpasswd --cluster <cluster_name> --name <idp_name> --username <user_name> --password '<password>'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must include the password within quotes like `'password'` to prevent your password from disrupting the Bash commands.

Passwords must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers or symbols, specifically, ASCII-standard characters only. The password must be at least 14 characters.
