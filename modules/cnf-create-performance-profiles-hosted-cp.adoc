= Creating a performance profile for hosted control planes

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a cluster performance profile by using the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool. The PPC is a function of the Node Tuning Operator. 

The PPC combines information about your cluster with user-supplied configurations to generate a performance profile that is appropriate to your hardware, topology, and use-case. The following high-level workflow creates and applys a performance profile in your cluster:

. Gather information about your cluster by using the `must-gather` command.
. Use the PPC tool to create a performance profile.
. Apply the performance profile to your cluster.
