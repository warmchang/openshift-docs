= The Audit JSON log enricher

[role="_abstract"]
The SPO Advanced Audit Logging Framework is enabled by the Audit JSON log enricher. Similar to the log enricher feature, the Audit JSON log enricher watches the `auditd` (`/var/log/audit/audit.log`) or the `syslog` (`/var/log/syslog`) daemons and generates a new audit log in JSON lines format.

Each JSON line includes the following:

* Timestamp: When the activity happened, shown in a standard ISO format
* Executable Name: The name of the program that was run (`bash`, `ls`).
* Linux Command Line Arguments (`cmdline`): The extra instructions given when the program was started (`ls -l /home`).
* User and Group IDs (`UID/GID`): The identification numbers of the system user who ran the program.
* System Calls (`syscalls`): A list of system calls (`syscalls`) that the process made

This log format and configuration is similar to how Kubernetes records audit logs. This is useful for:

* Seeing what users and automated processes are doing inside a pod.
* Tracking when someone uses commands such as `kubectl exec` to enter a running container and run commands or scripts.
* Monitoring activities in debug containers where users might run various tools.
