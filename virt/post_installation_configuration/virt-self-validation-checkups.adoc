[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can run a self validation checkup to validate the stability, health, and compliance of an {VirtProductName} installation. A self validation checkup enables you to run conformance tests on critical subsystems, such as networking and storage, to verify that the environment is fully functional and self-sustained before you deploy production workloads.

Running a self validation checkup streamlines the process of running functional tests, which are fully aligned with the exact build version of {VirtProductName} currently installed on the cluster.

You can view high-level summaries and detailed logs in a downloaded results file, or run tier 2 tests, enabling you to identify and resolve configuration issues without requiring external support immediately.
