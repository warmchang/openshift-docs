////
* drafty draft to get words on the page and an overall sense of new feature.
* may not stay own assembly; may need to be slotted somewhere. but it also might make sense to keep it as its own assembly so as not to make the observing-network-traffic.adoc assembly even larger.
* worth considering collecting FlowCollector info and putting it all together, except for the API since that is auto-generated.
* should enable, configure, disable be leveloffset=+2?
* fix titles and URLs once content is structured/organized
