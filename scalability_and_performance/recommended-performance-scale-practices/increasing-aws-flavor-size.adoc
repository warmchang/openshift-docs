= Selecting a larger AWS instance type for control plane machines
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: increasing-aws-flavor-size.adoc

toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
If the control plane machines in an {aws-first} cluster require more resources, you can select a larger {aws-short} instance type for the control plane machines to use.

[NOTE]
====
The procedure for clusters that use a control plane machine set is different from the procedure for clusters that do not use a control plane machine set.

If you are uncertain about the state of the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR in your cluster, you can verify the CR status.
