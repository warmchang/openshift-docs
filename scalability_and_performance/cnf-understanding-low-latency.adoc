[role="_abstract"]
To meet 5G network performance requirements, review the principles of low latency tuning for cluster nodes. By using this configuration, you can reduce congestion and maintain the lowest possible latency for edge computing applications.

Maintaining a network architecture with the lowest possible latency is key for meeting the network performance requirements of 5G. Compared to 4G technology, with an average latency of 50 ms, 5G is targeted to reach latency of 1 ms or less. This reduction in latency boosts wireless throughput by a factor of 10.
